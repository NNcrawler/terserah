        "A hidden yet homey coffee shop. They have small indoor and large outdoor area. I was ordered cafe late banana. For me it's too sweet. Maybe for those who don't like sweet can ask it less sugar or less siroup. I was ordered ice americano as well and it tastes good. They have snacks and pasta with affordable price.",

        "I tried the Aglio and their signature coconut coffee and the taste was into my liking. However the portion of the food was too small considering the price point.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice with good ambience music until a group of people came then talking and laughing obnoxiously, ruining the moment for other customers. I'd like it more if the staff would come to give them a few words.",

        "A Consistently Delightful Experience\n\nAs a frequent visitor to Jakarta, I've had the pleasure of dining at Restaurant Bambaiya numerous times over the past year. Each visit has been a delightful experience, making it my go-to spot in the city. From exceptional service to delicious cuisine, this restaurant never fails to impress.\n\nThe service at Restaurant Bambaiya is top-notch. The servers are quick, responsive, and incredibly attentive, ensuring that every need is promptly taken care of. During lunchtime, the specials they offer are not only excellent in taste but also provide great value for money. The speedy service allows patrons to enjoy a satisfying meal without compromising their busy schedules.\n\nOne aspect that stands out is the consistent quality of their dishes. Whether it's a classic favorite or a new menu item, the taste and presentation are always on point. I must highlight the Paneer Tikka, which, in my opinion, is the best I've had in Jakarta. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and the paneer is wonderfully marinated and cooked to perfection.\n\nFor those who enjoy the fresh air while dining, Restaurant Bambaiya offers a lovely outdoor seating area. It's a great option for a relaxed and enjoyable meal, especially in pleasant weather. Moreover, if you prefer indoor seating, they have plenty of comfortable space to accommodate guests."

The sauces suit with the fried cassava well. Recommended!\n\nIndonesian Stir-Fry Noodle (IDR 52,000)\nA plate of Javanese style fried noodle with shredded chicken, fried egg, cabbage, tomato, vegetables, spring onions, fried onions, and crackers.\n\nMoroccan Mint (IDR 38,000)\nThis is one of the TWG tea here.

The food was exceptional, with a variety of perfectly cooked meats and a great selection of sides. The standout was the service, especially from Dewi, who was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. Her recommendations made my meal even better. The ambiance was vibrant and welcoming. Highly recommend visiting for a fantastic Brazilian BBQ experience!",

I love this place, specially they design and decorate with  stuff that that unusual, such as many kind of clocks, the big ones and small ones. They look retro stuffs, with bicycle and some old telephones. It is so instagraemable. Great place to hang out, of course. Listening some music,  taking pics, too.",
        "One of the biggest letdowns I've ever experienced.\n\nI came during the off-time (3.30-ish) and a lot of the buffet food was either not ready or looked like leftovers from the lunch service.\n\nThere was only little food left in the buffet, and there were no signs of refilling it until the time for dinner service approaches.\n\nThere was a huge bowl of es campur, which was no longer \"es\", and was sitting there in the open, lukewarm.\n\nThe ice cream in the fridge was mostly melted, and was unfit for consumption.\n\nThe BBQ sauce was very sour, as if a fresh lemon was just squeezed inside, either to add flavor or to mask something, I'm not sure. The other sauces tasted mostly the same (bbq and black pepper) with no distinction.\n\nThe saving grace was the meat, which was good, although some are more strongly seasoned than others. The service was also top-notch, but it was to be expected from a restaurant that is tied to a hotel.\n\nI recommend you to come to dine here only during the peak hours, because otherwise I'm sure that you will feel nothing but let down by the lack of life of the restaurant.\n\nOh, and the A/C is quite hot as well.",
